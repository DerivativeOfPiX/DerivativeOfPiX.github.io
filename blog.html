			<h1>Law 4: always say less than necessary</h1>
			<p><b>When you are trying to impress people with words</b>, the more you say, the more common you appear and less in control, even if you say something benign, it will seem original if you make it look more vague and sphinxlike. Powerful people impress and intimidate by saying less, the more you say the more prone you are to saying something foolish.<br />
			<br />
			<b>The first reason:</b> once the words are out you cannot take them back.
			Be particularly careful with sarcasm and fighting against people who are more powerful than you. The momentary satisfaction you gain with your biting words will be out weighed by the price you will pay for them in the future, rather swallow your pride and keep silent. When you want to reply aggressively then ask yourself "do I have a strategy with my response or is it just emotions I wanted to vent?"
			The human tongue is a beast few can master and it tries constantly to break out of it's cage. If not tamed then it will run wild and cause you grief.<br />
			If someone is trying to provoke you , ask yourself "why are they attacking you ?are they jealous ?have you done something that makes then insecure or offended them or make them look bad ?" When you can't find a reason and they just like picking on you, use the <b>Deterrence Strategy:</b> when someone more powerful than you attacks you or threatens you, make it clear that they will suffer in return. He or she may be stronger and will be able to win battle but you will make him pay for each victory. Instead of taking him on directly you must hurt something he values, something close to home. Make him understand that every time he bothers you he can expect "damage" even if it's on a smaller scale. Then the only way for you to stop attacking him will be for him to stop attacking you.
			You're like a wasp on his skin, most people leave wasps alone. Reversal if your opponent gets angry enough to play the same game back at you then it may escalate a squabble to a retaliatory war. Use this strategy with caution.<br />
			<br />
			<b>The second reason:</b> you starve your enemies of information
			The more you speak, the more your words and information can be used against you in the future. Speaking less would make other  people reveal more about themselves than you will. When you speak you learn nothing but when you listen you can use that information in the future. Asking "what" questions and mirroring behaviour is the best strategy to make people open up to you.<br />
			<br />
			<b>The third reason:</b> you appear dangerous and unpredictable.
			Loius the 14th was a man of very few words. His infamous "I shall see " was one of several extremely short phrases that he would apply to all manner of requests. No one could understand where he stood or how to predict his reactions, no one could try to deceive him by saying what they thought he wanted to hear because they never knew what he wanted to hear, as they talked on and on to the silent Louis they revealed more information about themselves, information that he would later use against them into great effect, in the end Loius' silence kept those around him terrified. It was one of the foundations of his power. As saint Simon wrote " no one knew as well as he how to sell his words, his smile even his glances... Everything in him was valuable because he created differences and his majesty was enhanced by the sparseness of his words."<br />
			Saying less than necessary is not for statesmen only. In most areas of life,the less you say, the more profound and mysterious you appear. By saying less than necessary you create the appearance of meaning and power.<br />
			<br />
			<b>The fourth reason:</b> saying less will keep you from saying something foolish or even dangerous.
			In 1825 there was a Russian uprising and one of the leaders named kondraty Ryleyev was to be executed. Ryleyev stood on the Gallows, noose around his neck. The trap door opened,but the rope broke dashing him to the ground. Ryleyev was saved from execution.
			As he got to his feet he called out to the crowd and said " you see in Russia they don't know how to do anything properly, not even how to make a rope!"<br />
			at the time, events like this we're considered to be a sign of heavenly will, and a man saved from execution this way was usually pardoned. A messenger immediately went to the Winter Palace with the news of the failed hanging. The Czar was about to sign his pardon but then asked," did Ryleyev say anything after this miracle?" The messenger replied" he said that in Russia they don't even know how to make rope."<br />
			"In that case" said the Czar," let us prove the contrary." And he tore up the pardon. The next day Ryleyev was hung again. This time the rope did not break. Saying something foolish often will not get you killed, depending on where you are of course. Nevertheless the repercussions can be still be dire. A person who shows that he cannot control his own words and tongue shows that he cannot control himself and is unworthy of respect.<br />
			Reversal to this law: there are times when it is unwise to be silent.
			Silence can arouse suspicion and even insecurity, especially in your superiors; a vague or amibiguous comment can open you up to interpretations that you had not bargained for. Silence and saying less than necessary must be practiced in caution, then, and in the right situations.<br />
			It is occasionally wiser to imitate the court jester, who plays the fool but knows he is smarter than the king. He talks and talks and entertains, and no one suspects that he is more than just a fool. Also, words can sometimes act as a smokescreen for any deception you might practice, the more you talk ,in fact, the less suspicious of you they become. Be strategically silent. Don't be silent for no purpose, don't do anything without a purpose. Know why you say the things you do.</p>
