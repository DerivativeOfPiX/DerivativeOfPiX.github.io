			<h1>Something about me...</h1>
			<p>Hi, my name is _________, I am a highschool student, currently doing
			my A Levels, I am a big intellectual and think that equal pay is a myth, men are superior and women are mentally ill thanks for coming to my TED talk, yais yas yas kuweeen, kuweeen >_< <br />

			Yo what the fuck happened to Bowser? He's a girl now? That's fucking gross. Dude, there's porn of him? What the fuck? I'd never look at something like that, how disgusting. Can you stop spamming me with girl Bowser porn? It's fucking nasty, I don't like it, if you send that to me again, I'm blocking you. People are still sending me girl Bowser porn, what do they call it, Bowserette or some shit? She's not even that hot, fuck off. Wow, some of this Bowsette porn is kinda sexy, I might look at some more. It's been 3 days, I've been sitting on my couch looking at Bowsette porn, I jacked off to her 12 times in the past 2 hours, I don't think I can stop, everytime I look away I see her giant pepperoni nipples poking out from her cleavage and it makes my dick hard, I don't think this is normal. It's been 2 weeks and I haven't stopped jacking off to Bowserette, I've gone on every Twitter account there is to find more, my gallery is already at 1,264, I don't plan on stopping. I started dressing up as Mario and bought a fleshlight and put it in between my mattresses and starting thrusting into it with a picture of Bowsette on my bed, my fleshlight is full of cum but I can't stop. I haven't showered in 2 months, my mom kicked me out of the house, but I printed out pictures of Bowsette and I jack off to them behind Walmart inside a dumpster, I'm starting to get hungry but I'm okay since I have my pictures of Bowsette to jack off to. I've gotten really hungry and started eating my pictures of Bowsette, I'm starting to run out, please send me some more printed pictures of Bowsette, I don't think I can live without her.</p>
